Requirements:

Classes and Hierarchies:

1.Create classes to represent planets, stars, moons, and other celestial bodies.
Establish a class hierarchy that captures common characteristics such as orbits, sizes, and atmospheric composition.
2.Orbital Dynamics:

Implement realistic orbital dynamics of celestial bodies. Consider factors such as elliptical orbits, orbital speeds, and gravitational influence between bodies.
3.Interactivity:

Develop an interactive interface that allows the user to explore the solar system. This may include zooming, rotating, and selecting celestial bodies.
4.Detailed information:

Allow the user to get detailed information about each celestial body when selecting it. This may include data such as mass, temperature, composition and other relevant details.
5.Animation and Graphic Visualization:

Use graphics to create a compelling visual representation of the solar system. Implement realistic animations to simulate the movement of celestial bodies over time.
6.System setup:

Provide options for configuring the solar system, such as adding/removing celestial bodies, adjusting orbital parameters, and changing the timescale.
7.Additional Features:

Add extra features, such as simulating eclipses, seasons, and specific astronomical events.
